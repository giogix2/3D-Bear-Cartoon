# 3D-Bear-Cartoon
##Interactive 3D scene, created with C++ and OpengGl, inspired by a cartoon.

It has been developed an application which draws a 3D object, composed by many parts, connected between them with hierarchical methods. The object is supposed to move with a simple animation. Another task of this application was the creation of a particle system feature, with constrains and collision detection. Finally a waves animation system has been developed, which simulate a pool with moving water in it.
